          <p><s>A superconductor is a material that can conduct electricity without resistance below a <rs type="tc">superconducting transition temperature</rs>, <rs type="tc">T c</rs> . The <rs type="tc">highest T c</rs> that has been achieved to date is in the <rs type="class">copper oxide</rs> system : <rs type="tcValue" xml:id="x8">133 kelvin</rs> at <rs corresp="#x8" type="pressure">ambient pressure</rs> and <rs type="tcValue" xml:id="x10">164 kelvin</rs> at <rs corresp="#x10" type="pressure">high pressures</rs> . As the nature of superconductivity in these materials is still not fully understood (they are not conventional superconduc- tors), the prospects for achieving still higher transition tempera- tures by this route are not clear. In contrast, the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory of conventional superconductivity gives a guide for achieving high <rs type="tc">T c</rs> with no theoretical upper bound-all that is needed is a favourable combination of high-frequency phonons, strong electron-phonon coupling, and a high density of states . These conditions can in principle be fulfilled for <rs type="material">metallic hydrogen</rs> and <rs type="class">covalent compounds dominated by hydrogen</rs> , as <rs type="material">hydrogen</rs> atoms provide the necessary high-frequency phonon modes as well as the strong electron-phonon coupling. Numerous <rs type="me_method">calculations</rs> support this idea and have predicted <rs type="tc">transition temperatures</rs> in the range <rs type="tcValue">50-235 kelvin</rs> for many <rs type="class">hydrides</rs> , but only a moderate <rs type="tc">T c</rs> of <rs type="tcValue">17 kelvin</rs> has been observed experimentally . Here we investigate <rs type="material" xml:id="x19">sulfur hydride</rs> , where a <rs type="tc">T c</rs> of <rs corresp="#x19,#x2-230" type="tcValue">80 kelvin</rs> has been <rs type="me_method" xml:id="x2-230">predicted</rs> . We find that this system transforms to a metal at a pressure of approxi- mately 90 gigapascals. On cooling, we see signatures of supercon- ductivity: a sharp drop of the <rs type="me_method" xml:id="x2-263">resistivity</rs> to zero and a decrease of the <rs type="tc">transition temperature</rs> with magnetic field, with <rs type="me_method" xml:id="x23">magnetic sus- ceptibility measurements</rs> confirming a <rs type="tc">T c</rs> of <rs corresp="#x2-263,#x23" type="tcValue">203 kelvin</rs>. Moreover, a pronounced isotope shift of <rs type="tc">T c</rs> in <rs type="material">sulfur deuteride</rs> is suggestive of an electron-phonon mechanism of superconductivity that is con- sistent with the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer scenario. We argue that the phase responsible for high-T c superconductivity in this system is likely to be <rs type="material">H 3 S</rs>, formed from <rs type="material">H 2 S</rs> by decomposition under pressure. These findings raise hope for the prospects for achieving room-temperature superconductivity in other <rs type="class">hydro- gen-based materials</rs>.</s></p>

        <p><s>A search for high-(room)-temperature conventional superconduct- ivity is likely to be fruitful, as the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory in the Eliashberg formulation puts no apparent limits on <rs type="tc">T c</rs> . Materials with light elements are especially favourable as they provide high frequencies in the phonon spectrum. Indeed, many superconduc- tive materials have been found in this way, but only a moderately high <rs type="tc">T c</rs> 5 <rs corresp="#x34" type="tcValue">39 K</rs> has been found in this search (in <rs type="material" xml:id="x34">MgB 2</rs> ; ref. 11).</s></p>
        <p><s>Ashcroft turned attention to <rs type="material">hydrogen</rs>, which has very high vibra- tional frequencies due to the light <rs type="material">hydrogen</rs> atom and provides a strong electron-phonon interaction. Further <rs type="me_method" xml:id="x4-29">calculations</rs> showed that <rs type="material">metallic hydrogen</rs> should be a superconductor with a very high <rs type="tc">T c</rs> of about <rs corresp="#x4-29,#x38" type="tcValue">100-240 K</rs> for <rs type="material" xml:id="x38">molecular hydrogen</rs>, and of <rs corresp="#x38" type="tcValue" xml:id="x39">300-350 K</rs> in the atomic phase at <rs corresp="#x39" type="pressure">500 GPa</rs> (ref. ) . However, superconductivity in <rs type="material">pure hydrogen</rs> has not yet been found, even though a conductive and prob- ably semimetallic state of hydrogen has been recently produced . <rs type="class">Hydrogen-dominated materials</rs> such as <rs type="class">covalent hydrides</rs> <rs type="material">SiH 4</rs> , <rs type="material">SnH 4</rs> , and so on might also be good candidates for showing <rs type="tc">high-T c</rs> superconductivity . Similarly to <rs type="material">pure hydrogen</rs>, they have high Debye temperatures. Moreover, heavier elements might be beneficial as they contribute to the low frequencies that enhance electron-phonon coup- ling. Importantly, lower pressures are required to metallize <rs type="class">hydrides</rs> in comparison to <rs type="material">pure hydrogen</rs>. Ashcroft's general idea was supported in numerous <rs type="me_method">calculations</rs> 7,10 predicting high values of <rs type="tc">T c</rs> for many <rs type="class">hydrides</rs>. So far only a low <rs type="tc">T c</rs> (,<rs type="tcValue">17 K</rs>) has been observed experiment- ally .</s></p>
        <p><s>For the present study we selected <rs type="material" xml:id="x52">H 2 S</rs>, because it is relatively easy to handle and is predicted to transform to a metal and a superconductor at a low pressure P <rs corresp="#x55" type="pressure">&lt; 100 GPa</rs> with a high <rs type="tc">T c</rs> <rs corresp="#x52" type="tcValue" xml:id="x55">&lt; 80 K</rs> (ref. ) . Experimentally, <rs type="material">H 2 S</rs> is known as a typical molecular compound with a rich phase diagram . At about 96 GPa, <rs type="material">hydrogen sulphide</rs> trans- forms to a metal . The transformation is complicated by the partial dissociation of <rs type="material">H 2 S</rs> and the appearance of elemental <rs type="material">sulfur</rs> at P . 27 GPa at room temperature, and at higher pressures at lower tempera- tures . Therefore, the metallization of <rs type="material">hydrogen sulphide</rs> can be explained by elemental <rs type="material">sulfur</rs>, which is known to become metallic above 95 GPa (ref. . No experimental studies of <rs type="material">hydrogen sulphide</rs> are known above 100 GPa.</s></p>
        <p><s>In a typical experiment, we performed loading and the initial pres- sure increase at temperatures of ,200 K; this is essential for obtaining a good sample (Methods). The Raman spectra of <rs type="material">H 2 S</rs> and <rs type="material">D 2 S</rs> were measured as the pressure was increased, and were in general agreement with the literature data (Extended Data ). The sample starts to conduct at P &lt; 50 GPa. At this pressure it is a semiconductor, as shown by the temperature dependence of the <rs type="me_method">resistance</rs> and pronounced photoconductivity. At <rs type="pressure">90-100 GPa</rs> the <rs type="me_method">resistance</rs> drops further, and the temperature dependence becomes metallic. No photoconductive response is observed in this state. It is a poor metal-its <rs type="me_method">resistivity</rs> at ,100 K is r &lt; 3 3 10 25 ohm m at 110 GPa and r &lt; 3 3 10 27 ohm m at ,200 GPa.</s></p>
        <p><s>During the cooling of the metal at pressures of about 100 GPa ) the <rs type="me_method">resistance</rs> abruptly drops by three to four orders of magnitude, <rs type="tc">indicating a transition to the superconducting state</rs>. At the next increase of pressure at low temperatures of T , 100 K, <rs type="tc">T c steadily increases</rs> with pressure. However, at pressures of .160 GPa, <rs type="tc">T c increases sharply</rs> . As higher temperatures of 150-250 K were involved in this pressure range, we supposed that the <rs type="tc">increase of T c</rs> and the decrease of sample resistance during warming ) could indicate a possible kinetic-controlled phase transformation. Therefore in further experiments, after loading and after the initial pressure increase at 200 K, we annealed all samples by heating them to room temperature (or above) at pressures of .,150 GPa , see also Extended Data ). This allowed us to obtain stable results, to compare different isotopes, to obtain the dependence of <rs type="tc">T c</rs> on pressure and magnetic field, and to prove the existence of supercon- ductivity in our samples as follows. (We note that additional informa- tion on experimental conditions are given in the appropriate figure legends.) (1) There is a sharp drop in <rs type="me_method">resistivity</rs> with cooling, indicating a phase transformation. The measured minimum <rs type="me_method">resistance</rs> is at least as low, ,10 211 ohm m-about two orders of magnitude less than for pure copper (Extended Data Fig. 3e) measured at the same temperature . (2) A strong isotope effect is observed: <rs type="tc">T c shifts to lower temperatures</rs> for <rs type="material">sulfur deuteride</rs>, indicating phonon-assisted super- conductivity (Fig. 2b, c). The BCS theory gives the dependence of <rs type="tc">T c</rs> on atomic mass m as T c / m 2a , where a &lt; 0.5. Comparison of <rs type="tc">T c</rs> values in the pressure range P . 170 GPa (Fig. 2c) gives a &lt; 0.3.

        <p><s>low-temperature runs possibly relates to <rs type="material" xml:id="x142">H 2 S</rs>, as it is generally consistent with <rs type="me_method" xml:id="x14-18">calculations</rs> 10 for <rs type="material" xml:id="x143">H 2 S</rs>: both the value of <rs type="tc">T c</rs> <rs corresp="#x142,#x14-18,#x143" type="tcValue">&lt; 80 K</rs> and its pressure behaviour. However superconductivity with <rs type="tc">T c</rs> <rs corresp="#x159" type="tcValue">&lt;200 K</rs> does not follow from these <rs type="me_method">calculations</rs>. We suppose that it relates to the <rs type="material">decomposition of H 2 S</rs>, as high temperatures are required to reach the high <rs type="tc">T c</rs> . Precipitation of <rs type="material">elemental sulfur</rs> on decomposition could be expected (which is well known at low pres- sures of P , 100 GPa; ref. 14); however the <rs type="tc">superconducting transition</rs> in <rs type="material">elemental sulfur</rs> occurs at significantly lower temperatures . Another expected product of decomposition of <rs type="material">H 2 S</rs> is hydrogen. However, the strong characteristic vibrational stretching mode from the H 2 molecule was never observed in our Raman spectra (nor was it observed in ref. 14). Therefore we suppose that the dissociation of <rs type="material">H 2 S</rs> is different and involves the creation of higher <rs type="class">hydrides</rs>, such as <rs type="material">3H 2 S R H 6 S 1 2S</rs> or <rs type="material">2H 2 S R H 4 S 1 S</rs>. It is natural to expect these reactions, as sulfur can be not only divalent, but also exhibits higher valencies. In fact, calculations indirectly support this hypothesis, as the dissoci- ation <rs type="material">H 2 S R H 2 1 S</rs> was shown to be energetically very unfavourable. We found further theoretical support in ref. . In that work, the van der Waals compound 21 <rs type="material">(H 2 S) 2 H 2</rs> was considered, and it was shown that at pressures above 180 GPa it forms an Im-3m structure with <rs type="material" xml:id="x159">H 3 S</rs> stoichiometry.

Our hypothesis of the transformation of <rs type="material">H 2 S</rs> to higher hydrides (in the <rs type="material" xml:id="x163">H 3 S</rs> stoichiometry each S atom is surrounded by 6 hydrogen atoms) is strongly supported by further calculations .

        <p><s>The <rs type="tc">highest T c</rs> of <rs corresp="#x170" type="tcValue">203 K</rs> that we report here has been achieved most probably in <rs type="material" xml:id="x170">H 3 S</rs> having the Im-3m structure. It is a good metal; inter- estingly, there is also strong covalent bonding between H and S atoms in this compound . This is in agreement with the general assumption (see for instance ref. ) that a metal with high <rs type="tc">T c</rs> should have strong covalent bonding (as is realized in <rs type="material">MgB 2</rs> ; ref. ) together with high- frequency modes in the phonon spectrum. This particular combination of bonding type and phonon spectrum would probably provide a good criterion when searching for the materials with high <rs type="tc">T c</rs> at ambient pressure that are required for applications. There are many hydro- gen-containing materials with strong covalent bonding (such as organ- ics) but typically they are insulators. In principle, they could be tuned to a metallic state by doping or gating. Modern methods of structure prediction could facilitate exploration for the desired materials.</s></p>

        <p><s>Experimental procedure. For electrical measurements we used diamond anvil cells (DACs) with anvils of the following shape: tip diameter of 200-300 mm bevelled at 7-8u to a culet of 40-80 mm. An insulating gasket is required to separate the metallic gasket from the electrodes. It was prepared in the following way (Extended . First a metallic gasket of T301 stainless steel (or Re) 250 mm thick was indented with about 17-20 GPa pressure. Then the bottom of the imprint of diameter ,200 mm was drilled out, and a powder insulating material was put in the imprint and pressed between the anvils to form a layer. The insulating layer was made of either Teflon, NaCl or CaSO 4 as these materials do not react with <rs type="material">H 2 S</rs>. The layer was pressed to obtain a thickness in the centre of ,3-5 mm to provide stable clamping. A larger thickness leads to instability in the sample-it shifts or escapes under pressure-while with a thinner gasket it is difficult to reach high pressures. A hole of diameter ,10-30 mm was then drilled in the insulating layer. Four Ti electrodes were sputtered on the diamond anvil. The electrodes were capped with Au to prevent oxidation of the Ti. (To check a possible contribution of the diamond surface to the conductivity, we prepared a different configuration of electrodes for a once-only experiment: two electrodes were sput- tered on one anvil and another two on another anvil, similar to ref. . After preparation of the electrodes the gasket was put back on the anvil and the DAC was assembled so that the separation between the anvils was about 20-100 mm (mea- sured by interference fringes). The DAC was placed into a cryostat and cooled down to ,200 K (within the temperature range of liquid H 2 S) and then <rs type="material">H 2 S</rs> gas was put through a capillary into a rim around the diamond anvil where it liquefied (Extended Data ). <rs type="material">H 2 S</rs> of 99.5% and <rs type="material">D 2 S</rs> of 97% purity were been used. The filling was monitored visually (Extended Data Figs 4, 5) and the sample was identified by measuring Raman spectra. Then liquid <rs type="material">H 2 S</rs> was clamped in the gasket hole by pushing the piston of the DAC with the aid of screws outside the cryostat. The thickness of the sample can be estimated to be few micrometres, as measured from interference spectra through the clamped transparent sample. The thickness might be ,1 mm if the sample expanded over the culet . After the clamping, the DAC was heated to ,220 K to evaporate the rest of the <rs type="material">H 2 S</rs>, and then the pressure was further increased at this temperature. The pressure remained stable during the cooling within 65 GPa. The pressure was determined by a diamond edge scale at room temperature and low temperatures 32 . For optical measurements a Raman spectrometer was equipped with a nitrogen-cooled CCD and notch filters. The 632.8 nm line of a He-Ne laser was used to excite the Raman spectra and to determine pressure.</s></p>
        <p><s>The low temperature loading seems to be required to prepare samples with high <rs type="tc">T c</rs> . If <rs type="material">H 2 S</rs> was loaded at room temperature in the gas loader, for example, only sulfur was detected in Raman and X-ray scattering. Apparently in this route the sample decomposes before reaching the required high-pressure phase of H 3 S. We did not explore all (P,T) paths to reach the state with high <rs type="tc">T c</rs> .
