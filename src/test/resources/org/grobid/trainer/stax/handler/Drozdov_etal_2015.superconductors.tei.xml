		<p>Conventional <tc>superconductivity</tc> at <tcValue id="1">203 kelvin</tcValue> at <pressure ptr="#1">high pressures</pressure> in the <class>sulfur hydride</class> system</p>
		<p>A superconductor is a material that can conduct electricity without resistance below a <tc>superconducting transition temperature</tc>, <tc>T c</tc> . The <tc>highest T c</tc> that has been achieved to date is in the <class>copper oxide</class> system 1 : <tcValue id="8">133 kelvin</tcValue> at <pressure ptr="#8">ambient pressure</pressure> 2 and <tcValue id="10">164 kelvin</tcValue> at <pressure ptr="#10">high pressures</pressure> . As the nature of superconductivity in these materials is still not fully understood (they are not conventional superconductors), the prospects for achieving still higher transition temperatures by this route are not clear. In contrast, the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory of conventional superconductivity gives a guide for achieving <tc>high T c</tc> with no theoretical upper bound-all that is needed is a favourable combination of high-frequency phonons, strong electron-phonon coupling, and a high density of states . These conditions can in principle be fulfilled for <material>metallic hydrogen</material> and <class>covalent compounds dominated by hydrogen</class> , as hydrogen atoms provide the necessary high-frequency phonon modes as well as the strong electron-phonon coupling. Numerous <me_method>calculations</me_method> support this idea and have predicted <tc>transition temperatures</tc> in the range <tcValue>50-235 kelvin</tcValue> for many <class>hydrides</class> , but only a moderate <tc>T c</tc> of <tcValue>17 kelvin</tcValue> has been observed experimentally . Here we investigate <material id="19">sulfur hydride</material> , where a <tc>T c</tc> of <tcValue ptr="#19">80 kelvin</tcValue> has been <me_method>predicted</me_method> . We find that this system transforms to a metal at a pressure of approximately 90 gigapascals. On cooling, we see signatures of superconductivity: a sharp drop of the <me_method>resistivity</me_method> to zero and a decrease of the <tc>transition temperature</tc> with magnetic field, with <me_method>magnetic susceptibility measurements</me_method> confirming a <tc>T c</tc> of <tcValue>203 kelvin</tcValue>. Moreover, a pronounced isotope shift of <tc>T c</tc> in <material>sulfur deuteride</material> is suggestive of an electron-phonon mechanism of superconductivity that is consistent with the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer scenario. We argue that the phase responsible for high-T c superconductivity in this system is likely to be <material>H 3 S</material>, formed from <material>H 2 S</material> by decomposition under pressure. These findings raise hope for the prospects for achieving room-temperature superconductivity in other <class>hydrogen-based materials</class>.</p>
		<p>A search for high-(room)-temperature conventional superconductivity is likely to be fruitful, as the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory in the Eliashberg formulation puts no apparent limits on <tc>T c</tc> . Materials with light elements are especially favourable as they provide high frequencies in the phonon spectrum. Indeed, many superconductive materials have been found in this way, but only a moderately <tc>high T c</tc> 5 <tcValue ptr="#34">39 K</tcValue> has been found in this search (in <material id="34">MgB 2</material> ; ref. 11).</p>
		<p>Ashcroft turned attention to <material>hydrogen</material>, which has very high vibrational frequencies due to the light hydrogen atom and provides a strong electron-phonon interaction. Further <me_method>calculations</me_method> showed that <material>metallic hydrogen</material> should be a superconductor with a very high <tc>T c</tc> of about <tcValue ptr="#38">100-240 K</tcValue> for <material id="38">molecular hydrogen</material>, and of <tcValue id="39" ptr="#38">300-350 K</tcValue> in the atomic phase at <pressure ptr="#39">500 GPa</pressure> (ref. . However, superconductivity in <material>pure hydrogen</material> has not yet been found, even though a conductive and probably semimetallic state of hydrogen has been recently produced . <class>Hydrogen-dominated materials</class> such as <class>covalent hydrides</class> <material>SiH 4</material> , <material>SnH 4</material> , and so on might also be good candidates for showing <tc>high-T c</tc> superconductivity . Similarly to <material>pure hydrogen</material>, they have high Debye temperatures. Moreover, heavier elements might be beneficial as they contribute to the low frequencies that enhance electron-phonon coupling. Importantly, lower pressures are required to metallize <class>hydrides</class> in comparison to <material>pure hydrogen</material>. Ashcroft&#x27;s general idea was supported in numerous <me_method>calculations</me_method> 7,10 predicting high values of <tc>T c</tc> for many <class>hydrides</class>. So far only a low <tc>T c</tc> (,<tcValue>17 K</tcValue>) has been observed experimentally .</p>
		<p>For the present study we selected <material id="52">H 2 S</material>, because it is relatively easy to handle and is predicted to transform to a metal and a superconductor at a low pressure P <pressure ptr="#55">&lt; 100 GPa</pressure> with a high <tc>T c</tc> <tcValue id="55" ptr="#52">&lt; 80 K</tcValue> (ref. . Experimentally, <material>H 2 S</material> is known as a typical molecular compound with a rich phase diagram . At about 96 GPa, <material>hydrogen sulphide</material> transforms to a metal . The transformation is complicated by the partial dissociation of <material>H 2 S</material> and the appearance of elemental <material>sulfur</material> at P . 27 GPa at room temperature, and at higher pressures at lower temperatures . Therefore, the metallization of <material>hydrogen sulphide</material> can be explained by elemental <material>sulfur</material>, which is known to become metallic above 95 GPa (ref. . No experimental studies of <material>hydrogen sulphide</material> are known above 100 GPa.</p>
		<p>In a typical experiment, we performed loading and the initial pressure increase at temperatures of ,200 K; this is essential for obtaining a good sample (Methods). The Raman spectra of <material>H 2 S</material> and <material>D 2 S</material> were measured as the pressure was increased, and were in general agreement with the literature data (Extended Data ). The sample starts to conduct at P &lt; 50 GPa. At this pressure it is a semiconductor, as shown by the temperature dependence of the <me_method>resistance</me_method> and pronounced photoconductivity. At 90-100 GPa the <me_method>resistance</me_method> drops further, and the temperature dependence becomes metallic. No photoconductive response is observed in this state. It is a poor metal-its <me_method>resistivity</me_method> at ,100 K is r &lt; 3 3 10 25 ohm m at 110 GPa and r &lt; 3 3 10 27 ohm m at ,200 GPa.</p>
		<p>During the cooling of the metal at pressures of about 100 GPa ) the <me_method>resistance</me_method> abruptly drops by three to four orders of magnitude, <tc>indicating a transition to the superconducting state</tc>. At the next increase of pressure at low temperatures of T , 100 K, <tc>T c steadily increases</tc> with pressure. However, at pressures of .160 GPa, <tc>T c increases sharply</tc> . As higher temperatures of 150-250 K were involved in this pressure range, we supposed that the <tc>increase of T c</tc> and the decrease of sample resistance during warming ) could indicate a possible kinetic-controlled phase transformation. Therefore in further experiments, after loading and after the initial pressure increase at 200 K, we annealed all samples by heating them to room temperature (or above) at pressures of .,150 GPa , see also Extended Data ). This allowed us to obtain stable results, to compare different isotopes, to obtain the dependence of <tc>T c</tc> on pressure and magnetic field, and to prove the existence of superconductivity in our samples as follows. (We note that additional information on experimental conditions are given in the appropriate figure legends.) (1) There is a sharp drop in <me_method>resistivity</me_method> with cooling, indicating a phase transformation. The measured minimum <me_method>resistance</me_method> is at least as low, ,10 211 ohm m-about two orders of magnitude less than for pure copper (Extended Data Fig. 3e) measured at the same temperature 19 . (2) A strong isotope effect is observed: <tc>T c shifts to lower temperatures</tc> for <material>sulfur deuteride</material>, indicating phonon-assisted superconductivity (Fig. 2b, c). The BCS theory gives the dependence of <tc>T c</tc> on atomic mass m as T c / m 2a , where a &lt; 0.5. Comparison of <tc>T c</tc> values in the pressure range P . 170 GPa (Fig. 2c) gives a &lt; 0.3. (3) <tc>T c shifts to lower temperatures</tc> with available magnetic field (B) up to</p>

The sample was pressurized to <pressure ptr="#80">145 GPa</pressure> at 220 K and then cooled to 100 K. It was then slowly warmed at ,1 K min 21 ; <tc>T c</tc> 5 <tcValue id="80" ptr="#77">170 K</tcValue> was determined. At temperatures above ,<tcValue ptr="#77">250 K</tcValue> the <me_method>resistance</me_method> dropped sharply, and during the next temperature run <tc>T c increased</tc> to ,<tcValue ptr="#77">195 K</tcValue>. This <tc>T c</tc> remained nearly the same for the next two runs. (We note that the only point for <material>sulfur deuteride</material> presented in ref. 9 was determined without sample annealing, and T c would increase after annealing at room temperature.) b, Typical superconductive steps for <class>sulfur hydride</class> (blue trace) and <material>sulfur deuteride</material> (red trace). The data were acquired during slow warming over a time of several hours. <tc>T c</tc> is defined here as the sharp kink in the transition to normal metallic behaviour. These curves were obtained after annealing at room temperature as shown in a. c, Dependence of <tc>T c</tc> on pressure; data on annealed samples are presented. Open coloured points refer to <material>sulfur deuteride</material>, and filled points to <class>sulfur hydride</class>. Data shown as the magenta point were obtained in <me_method>magnetic susceptibility measurements</me_method> . The lines indicate that the plots are parallel at pressures above ,170 GPa (the isotope shift is constant) but strongly deviate at lower pressures.</p>

The pressure values are indicated near the corresponding plots. At first, the sample was loaded at T &lt; 200 K and the pressure was increased to ,100 GPa; the sample was then cooled down to 4 K. After warming to ,100 K, pressure was further increased. Plots at pressures ,135 GPa have been scaled (reduced) as follows-105 GPa, by 10 times; 115 GPa and 122 GPa, by 5 times; and 129 GPa by 2 times-for easier comparison with the higher pressure steps. The <me_method>resistance</me_method> was measured with a current of 10 mA. Bottom panel, the resistance plots near zero. The <me_method>resistance</me_method> was measured with four electrodes deposited on a diamond anvil that touched the sample (top panel inset). The diameters of the samples were ,25 mm and the thickness was ,1 mm. b, Blue round points represent values of <tc>T c</tc> determined from a. Other blue points (triangles and half circles) were obtained in similar runs. Measurements at P .,160 GPa revealed a <tc>sharp increase of T c</tc> . In this pressure range the R(T) measurements were performed over a larger temperature range up to 260 K, the corresponding experimental points for two samples are indicated by adding a pink colour to half circles and a centred dot to filled circles. These points probably reflect a transient state for these particular P/T conditions. Further annealing of the sample at room temperature would require stabilizing the sample . Black stars are calculations from ref. . Dark yellow points are <tc>T c</tc> values of <material>pure sulfur</material> obtained with the same four-probe <me_method>electrical measurement</me_method> method. They are consistent with literature data 30 (susceptibility measurements) but have higher values at P . 200 GPa.</p>

The <me_method>magnetization</me_method> curves show hysteresis, indicating a type II superconductor. The <me_method>magnetization</me_method> curves are however distorted by obvious paramagnetic input (which is also observed in other superconductors ). In our case, the paramagnetic signal is probably from the DAC, but further study of the origin of this input is required. The paramagnetic background increases when temperature is decreased. The minima of the <me_method>magnetization</me_method> curves (,35 mT) are the result of the diamagnetic input from superconductivity and the paramagnetic background. The first critical field H c1 &lt; 30 mT can be roughly estimated as the point where <me_method>magnetization</me_method> deviates from linear behaviour. At higher fields, <me_method>magnetization</me_method> increases due to the penetration of magnetic vortexes. As the sign of the field change reverses, the magnetic flux in the Shubnikov phase remains trapped and therefore the back run (that is, with decreasing field) is irreversible-the returning branch of the magnetic cycle (shown by filled points) runs above the direct one. Hysteretic behaviour of the <me_method>magnetization</me_method> becomes more clearly visible as the temperature decreases. d, At high temperatures T . 200 K, the <me_method>magnetization</me_method> decreases sharply. e, Extrapolation of the pronounced minima at the <me_method>magnetization</me_method> curves to higher temperatures gives the <tc>onset of superconductivity</tc> at T 5 <tcValue ptr="#137">203.5 K</tcValue>.</p>
		<p>low-temperature runs possibly relates to <material id="140">H 2 S</material>, as it is generally consistent with <me_method>calculations</me_method> 10 for <material id="141">H 2 S</material>: both the value of <tc>T c</tc> <tcValue ptr="#140,#141">&lt; 80 K</tcValue> and its pressure behaviour. However superconductivity with <tc>T c</tc> <tcValue ptr="#155">&lt;200 K</tcValue> does not follow from these calculations. We suppose that it relates to the <material>decomposition of H 2 S</material>, as high temperatures are required to reach the high <tc>T c</tc> . Precipitation of <material>elemental sulfur</material> on decomposition could be expected (which is well known at low pressures of P , 100 GPa; ref. 14); however the superconducting transition in <material>elemental sulfur</material> occurs at significantly lower temperatures . Another expected product of decomposition of <material>H 2 S</material> is hydrogen. However, the strong characteristic vibrational stretching mode from the H 2 molecule was never observed in our Raman spectra (nor was it observed in ref. 14). Therefore we suppose that the dissociation of H 2 S is different and involves the creation of higher <class>hydrides</class>, such as <material>3H 2 S R H 6 S 1 2S</material> or <material>2H 2 S R H 4 S 1 S</material>. It is natural to expect these reactions, as sulfur can be not only divalent, but also exhibits higher valencies. In fact, calculations indirectly support this hypothesis, as the dissociation <material>H 2 S R H 2 1 S</material> was shown to be energetically very unfavourable. We found further theoretical support in ref. . In that work, the van der Waals compound 21 <material>(H 2 S) 2 H 2</material> was considered, and it was shown that at pressures above 180 GPa it forms an Im-3m structure with <material id="155">H 3 S</material> stoichiometry. The <me_method>predicted</me_method> <tc>T c</tc> <tcValue ptr="#155">&lt; 190 K</tcValue> and its pressure dependences are close to our experimental values ). Our hypothesis of the transformation of <material>H 2 S</material> to higher hydrides (in the <material id="159">H 3 S</material> stoichiometry each S atom is surrounded by 6 hydrogen atoms) is strongly supported by further calculations . All the numerous works based on the Im-3m structure are consistent in their <me_method>prediction</me_method> of <tc>T c</tc> .,<tcValue ptr="#159">200 K</tcValue>, which decreases with pressure. The hydrogen sublattice gives the main contribution to superconductivity . Inclusion of zero point vibrations and anharmonicity in the calculations corrected the <me_method>calculated</me_method> <tc>T c</tc> to ,<tcValue ptr="#159">190 K</tcValue>, and the isotope coefficient from a 5 0.5 to a 5 0.35both in agreement with the present work.</p>
		<p>The <tc>highest T c</tc> of <tcValue ptr="#166">203 K</tcValue> that we report here has been achieved most probably in <material id="166">H 3 S</material> having the Im-3m structure. It is a good metal; interestingly, there is also strong covalent bonding between H and S atoms in this compound . This is in agreement with the general assumption (see for instance ref. ) that a metal with high <tc>T c</tc> should have strong covalent bonding (as is realized in <material>MgB 2</material> ; ref. ) together with highfrequency modes in the phonon spectrum. This particular combination of bonding type and phonon spectrum would probably provide a good criterion when searching for the materials with high <tc>T c</tc> at ambient pressure that are required for applications. There are many hydrogen-containing materials with strong covalent bonding (such as organics) but typically they are insulators. In principle, they could be tuned to a metallic state by doping or gating. Modern methods of structure prediction could facilitate exploration for the desired materials.</p>

		<p>Experimental procedure. For electrical measurements we used diamond anvil cells (DACs) with anvils of the following shape: tip diameter of 200-300 mm bevelled at 7-8u to a culet of 40-80 mm. An insulating gasket is required to separate the metallic gasket from the electrodes. It was prepared in the following way (Extended . First a metallic gasket of T301 stainless steel (or Re) 250 mm thick was indented with about 17-20 GPa pressure. Then the bottom of the imprint of diameter ,200 mm was drilled out, and a powder insulating material was put in the imprint and pressed between the anvils to form a layer. The insulating layer was made of either Teflon, NaCl or CaSO 4 as these materials do not react with <material>H 2 S</material>. The layer was pressed to obtain a thickness in the centre of ,3-5 mm to provide stable clamping. A larger thickness leads to instability in the sample-it shifts or escapes under pressure-while with a thinner gasket it is difficult to reach high pressures. A hole of diameter ,10-30 mm was then drilled in the insulating layer. Four Ti electrodes were sputtered on the diamond anvil. The electrodes were capped with Au to prevent oxidation of the Ti. (To check a possible contribution of the diamond surface to the conductivity, we prepared a different configuration of electrodes for a once-only experiment: two electrodes were sputtered on one anvil and another two on another anvil, similar to ref. . After preparation of the electrodes the gasket was put back on the anvil and the DAC was assembled so that the separation between the anvils was about 20-100 mm (measured by interference fringes). The DAC was placed into a cryostat and cooled down to ,200 K (within the temperature range of liquid H 2 S) and then <material>H 2 S</material> gas was put through a capillary into a rim around the diamond anvil where it liquefied (Extended Data ). <material>H 2 S</material> of 99.5% and <material>D 2 S</material> of 97% purity were been used. The filling was monitored visually (Extended Data Figs 4, 5) and the sample was identified by measuring Raman spectra. Then liquid <material>H 2 S</material> was clamped in the gasket hole by pushing the piston of the DAC with the aid of screws outside the cryostat. The thickness of the sample can be estimated to be few micrometres, as measured from interference spectra through the clamped transparent sample. The thickness might be ,1 mm if the sample expanded over the culet . After the clamping, the DAC was heated to ,220 K to evaporate the rest of the <material>H 2 S</material>, and then the pressure was further increased at this temperature. The pressure remained stable during the cooling within 65 GPa. The pressure was determined by a diamond edge scale at room temperature and low temperatures 32 . For optical measurements a Raman spectrometer was equipped with a nitrogen-cooled CCD and notch filters. The 632.8 nm line of a He-Ne laser was used to excite the Raman spectra and to determine pressure.</p>
		<p>The low temperature loading seems to be required to prepare samples with high <tc>T c</tc> . If <material>H 2 S</material> was loaded at room temperature in the gas loader, for example, only sulfur was detected in Raman and X-ray scattering. Apparently in this route the sample decomposes before reaching the required high-pressure phase of H 3 S. We did not explore all (P,T) paths to reach the state with high <tc>T c</tc> . We found however that <tc>superconductivity is not observed</tc> in sample loaded at ,200 K but heated to room temperature at low pressure ,100 GPa.</p>
		<p>The <me_method>resistance</me_method> and Raman spectra were measured during the pressurizing using the four-probe van der Pauw method (Extended Data ) with a current of 10-10,000 mA. The temperature was reliably determined by using a slow warming rate (,1 K min 21 ) and allowing the DAC to equilibrate with attached thermometer. The determined <tc>T c</tc> was well reproduced in measurements with the PPMS6000 (Physical Property Measurement System from Quantum Design) and other set-ups. <tc>T c</tc> was determined as the point of steepest change of <me_method>resistance</me_method> from the normal state .</p>
		<p>The influence of the magnetic field on superconducting transitions has been measured with a non-magnetic DAC (diameter 25 mm) in a PPMS6000 in a 4-300 K temperature range and fields up to 7 T.</p>
		<p><me_method>Magnetic susceptibility measurements</me_method> were performed in an MPMS (Magnetic Property Measurement System) from Quantum Design. For these measurements a miniature non-magnetic cell made of Cu:Ti alloy working up to 200 GPa was designed . Samples of diameter ,50-100 mm and a thickness of a few micrometres were prepared to provide a sufficient signal. <me_method>magnetic susceptibility measurement</me_method> using a high-pressure cell were performed using a background subtraction feature of the MPMS software of the SQUID magnetometer (Extended . Results. We present here some important key features of our new high-T c <class>sulfur hydride</class> superconductor: The new superconductor is of type II. This fact is clearly supported by (i) a difference in temperature-dependent ZFC and FC <me_method>magnetization</me_method> , which is due to the Meissner effect (ZFC) and magnetic flux capture when the sample is cooled down from its normal state (FC); and (ii) the magnetic hysteresis curves . The magnetic hysteresis curves also have all the features of typical type II superconductors with a mixed state between H c1 and H c2 .</p>
		<p>(2) A typical value of the coherence length j GL in the framework of the Ginzburg-Landau theory can be estimated on the basis of the measured upper critical fields from conductivity measurements ). Using the experimental estimation 60 T , H c2 , 80 T and the relation s we find limits for the coherence length: 2.3 nm . j GL . 2.0 nm. We note that this relatively short coherence length is of the same order as, for instance, the values for superconducting <material>YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7</material> (1.3 nm) and <material>Nb 3 Sn</material> (3.5 nm).</p>
		<p>(3) The London penetration depth l L can be estimated from the known relation of the lower critical field H c1 to the upper critical field H c2 for a type II superconductor in the limit k . 1 of the Ginzburg-Landau parameter k~l L j GL . Considering the experimental value of the first critical field of 3 3 10 22 T ) and the abovementioned relation 60 T , H c2 , 80 T, we can obtain the following estimate for the London penetration depth: l L &lt; 125 nm. (4) According to Bean&#x27;s model, the magnetic critical current density of the superconductor can be estimated from the distance between the direct and the returning branches of the magnetic hysteresis loop at a given magnetic field . Provided grain radii are about 0.1 mm, the intra-grain critical current J c is about 10 7 A cm 22 .</p>

The spectra are shifted relative to each other. At 51 GPa there is a phase transformation, as follows from disappearance of the characteristic vibron peaks in the 2,100-2,500 cm 21 range. The corresponding spectrum is highlighted as a bold curve. Bold curves at higher pressure (and the temperature of the measurement) are shown to follow qualitatively the changes of the spectra. The pressure corresponding to the unassigned plots can be determined from the Raman spectra of the stressed diamond anvil 32 . b, Raman spectra of <material>sulfur deuteride</material> measured at T &lt; 170 K and over the pressure range 1-70 GPa.</p>

		<p>Data Figure 2 | Temperature dependence of the <me_method>resistance</me_method> of <material id="190">sulfur hydride</material> at <pressure ptr="#193,#197">143 GPa</pressure>. In this run the sample was clamped in the DAC at T &lt; 200 K, and the pressure then increased to 103 GPa at this temperature; the further increase of pressure to 143 GPa was at ,100 K. a, After next cooling to ,15 K and subsequent warming, a superconducting transition with <tc>T c</tc> <tcValue id="193" ptr="#190">&lt; 60 K</tcValue> was observed, then the <me_method>resistance</me_method> strongly decreased with increasing temperature. After successive cooling and warming (b; only the warming curve is shown) a kink at 185 K appeared, indicating the <tc>onset of superconductivity</tc>. The <tc>superconducting transition</tc> is very broad: <tc>resistance dropped to zero</tc> only at ,<tcValue id="197" ptr="#190">22 K</tcValue>. There are apparent &#x27;oscillations&#x27; on the slope. Their origin is not clear, though they probably reflect inhomogeneity of the sample in the transient state before complete annealing. Similar &#x27;oscillations&#x27; have also been observed for other samples (see, for example, figure 3 in the Supplementary Information of ref. 9).</p>
		<p>Electrical measurements. a, Schematic drawing of diamond anvils with electrical leads separated from the metallic gasket by an insulating layer (shown orange). b, Ti electrodes sputtered on a diamond anvil shown in transmitted light. c, Scheme of the van der Pauw measurements: current leads are indicated by I, and voltage leads as U. d, Typical superconducting step measured in four channels (for different combinations of current and voltage leads shown in c). A sum resistance obtained from the van der Pauw formula is shown by the green line. Note here that the superconducting transition was measured with the un-annealed sample 9 . After warming to room temperature and successive cooling, <tc>T c</tc> should increase. e, Residual resistance measured below the superconducting transition (d). R min and r min are averaged over four channels shown by different colours. RESEARCH LETTER G2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved Extended Data Figure 4 | Loading of H 2 S. Gaseous H 2 S is passed through the capillary into a rim around the diamond anvils (upper panel). When the sample liquefies, in the temperature range 191 K , T , 213 K, it is clamped. The process of loading is shown on a video (https:/vimeo.com/131914556) and a still is shown here (lower panel). On the video, the camera is looking through a hole in the transparent gasket (CaSO 4 ), and shows a view through the diamond anvil. At T &lt; 200 K, the line to the <material>H 2 S</material> gas cylinder was opened and the gas condensed. At this moment, the picture changes due to the different refractive index of <material>H 2 S</material>. The second anvil with the sputtered electrodes was then pushed forward, and the hole was clamped. The sample changed colour during the next application of pressure. The red point is from the focused HeNe laser beam. LETTER RESEARCH G2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved Extended Data Figure 5 | View of D 2 S sample with electrical leads and transparent gasket (CaSO 4 ) at different pressures. The <material>D 2 S</material> is in the centre of these photographs, which were taken in a cryostat at 220 K with mixed illumination, both transmitted and reflected. Under this illumination, the insulating transparent gasket shows blue, and the electrodes yellow. The red spot is the focused HeNe laser beam. The sample, which is initially transparent, becomes opaque and then reflective as pressure is increased.</p>
		<p>Extended Data | <me_method>magnetic susceptibility measurement</me_method> with a SQUID. A typical sample ) has a disk shape (diameter 50-100 mm and thickness of few micrometres). In the superconductive state the magnetic moment for this disk is estimated as M(disk) &lt; 0.2r 3 H (ref. 33). For a disk of radius r 5 40 mm (a sample size typical for DACs in the megabar range) and H 5 2 mT the expected diamagnetic signal, M(disk) is estimated as 2.6 3 10 27 emu. This value is well above the sensitivity of the SQUID which is ,10 28 emu and, therefore, the signal can be detected. A high-pressure DAC made of Cu:Ti alloy has its own magnetic background signal (a) which increases sharply at low temperatures due to residual paramagnetic impurities. Signal from a large superconducting sample (for example, a <material>Bi-2223</material> superconductor) could still be detected without magnetic background subtraction. However, the <material>sulfur hydride</material> sample is not seen (b) unless background has been subtracted (c, d). The background signal acquired in the normal state immediately above T onset has been used for subtraction over all the temperature range taking into account that the magnetic moment of the DAC is fairly temperature independent above 100 K. c, <me_method>Magnetic measurements</me_method> for the sample of <material>sulfur hydride</material> at different magnetic fields (labels on curves). The data on <material>sulfur deuteride</material> (d) are compared with the <tc>superconducting transition</tc> in <me_method>resistivity</me_method> measurements (blue curve) which has been scaled to fit the susceptibility data (black points).</p>
