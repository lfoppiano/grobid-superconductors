# Models 


## Summary 
This table summarise the various models and evolution of evaluation. 

* In the BidLSTM+CRF column, the result between parenthesis is obtained by enabling [features layout](https://github.com/kermitt2/delft/pull/82). 
* Results might slightly variate. In some cases, we report multiple F1 results but a single detailed result. 
* The experiments using "[grobid-quantities](http://www.github.com/kermitt2/grobid-quantities) as features for `<pressure>` and `<tcValue>`" indicate the use of quantities identification as features for the this model (superconductors), instead of using them directly and ignoring `<pressure>` and `<tcValue>` from this model.
