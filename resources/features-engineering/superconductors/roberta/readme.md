# RoBERTa pre-training and fine tuning experiments

## Introduction

This page contains notes and information about the process of [RoBERTa](https://github.com/facebook/fairseq) for improving the results in the task
of NER for materials science scientific papers.

The data used is summarised [here](../scibert/readme.md).

### Preprocessing
In order to process the data with RoBERTa, we preprocessed the data to have an empty line as a document separator. 
 - concatenate each document adding an empty line between each other
 - split in sentences
